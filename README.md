# Procurement Spyder

### Problem

Money from World Bank supported projects impacts citizens and businesses directly
through the contracts that are awarded for public goods or services - such as
for laying roads or building schools. Surprisingly, not many many know about
these contracts weâ€™re investing in, even when they represent large amounts of
public money meant for their neighbourhood.

### Proposed Solutions

Procurement Spyder will have a knowledge of upcoming tender notices by
crawling world bank's site every day. Business owners can subscribe with the sectors and
location they are interested in. Procurement Spider notify business owners
whenever there is new tender or procurements under subscribed locations and sectors.
