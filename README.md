# Procurement Spy

Money from World Bank supported projects impacts citizens and businesses directly
through the contracts that are awarded for public goods or services - such as
for laying roads or building schools. Surprisingly, not many many know about
these contracts weâ€™re investing in, even when they represent large amounts of
public money meant for their neighbourhood.

1. Citizen oversight of who gets this money to do what and where can deter
corruption and improve quality of delivery.

2. Knowledge of upcoming tender notices can create a level playing field for
private sector, and be a useful resource for business owners.

Here we are solving second problem.
